# ForceBoardMetrics

**ForceBoardMetrics** is an open-source toolkit that transforms the Nintendo Wii Fit Balance Board into a low-cost force plate for collecting and analyzing human performance data. Designed for coaches, athletes, and sports scientists, it provides real-time force tracking, balance metrics, and jump take-off analysis — all on accessible, affordable hardware like the Raspberry Pi.

> ⚠️ A more advanced custom force board is currently in development. The Wii Fit Board version serves as a low-cost, proof-of-concept platform to prototype the software, data structures, and training workflows.
